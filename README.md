# IoT-Smart-Drip-Irrigation

Paper link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9225345


The water requirements for irrigation have
been very demanding nowadays. There is a requirement
for a wise irrigation system which will save a good
amount of water. In the world, water and food are two of
the most important resource, which makes agriculture
crucial to mankind. With advancing technology growth in
the agriculture sector, the internet-of-thing (IOT)
technology provides a solution much simpler and faster
for drip irrigation. Under this paper, an IOT enabled smart
drip irrigation system is being developed where a system
architecture is designed. A microcontroller along with a
nodeMCU is used for sending the data in the cloud in the
server. A web-based application is also developed so that
the user can take appropriate action accordingly for drip
irrigations. This web application accurately controls the
water level by employing a soil moisture sensor and
microcontroller system in the gardens. This is realized by
integrating the sensors within the developed prototype to
observe the soil moisture level, humidity, and temperature
conditions where these data send through the microcontroller and nodeMCU for the requirement of water to
the plants. Crop health can be monitored and controlled
through mobile and desktop computers and provides a
solution for smart farming, agricultural fields, Lawns,
gardening, etc.
